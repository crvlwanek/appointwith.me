# AppointWith.me

Work in progress...

AppointWith.me is going to be a web app for scheduling appointments both with individuals and groups alike. The motivation for its creation is for scheduling and tracking lessons for orchestra students. There will be support for creating groups to which you can invite other users to join. Hosts of a group can set the desired number and frequency of required appointments they would like guests to attend. Guests and hosts alike can track how many of the required appointments they have attended and see upcoming appointment details (time, location, participants) through a dashboard.
